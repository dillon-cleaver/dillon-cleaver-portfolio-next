            <p>
              Hi, I&apos;m Dillon! I&apos;m a frontend developer with a strong
              UI/UX sense, focused on building engaging web and mobile
              applications. With years of experience developing cross-platform
              apps for iOS, Android, and the web using React Native and the Expo
              framework, I thrive on crafting intuitive, high-performance user
              experiences.
            </p>
            <p>
              I&apos;m proficient in React Native, React, TypeScript, JavaScript
              (ES6+), Node.js, Redux, RESTful APIs, Firebase, and Expo. I also
              have a solid foundation in UX/UI design, Figma, and wireframing,
              collaborating seamlessly with designers and project managers to
              bring ideas to life.
            </p>
            <p>
              Beyond tech, my background spans 15+ years in retail, food
              service, freelance writing, and content creation, along with
              volunteer roles as a counselor, educator, treasurer, and activist.
              I&apos;m a native English speaker with conversational German
              (B2.2) and an avid traveler, reader, cinema lover, gamer, sports
              enthusiast, and lifelong learner.
            </p>
            <p>
              Currently, I&apos;m a full-stack software engineer at SecretLab in
              Minneapolis, Minnesota. Even with a full-time role, I make time
              for personal projects and continuous learningâ€”always seeking new
              challenges and opportunities to grow.
